An Ars Nouveau addon mod that adds new types of Sourcelinks.

Solar/Lunar Sourcelink - Constantly generates a small amount of source during the day/night respectively. Efficiency decreases for every Sourcelink of the same type within 2 blocks
Sculking Sourcelink - Generates source whenever a mob dies within 5 blocks, similar to a Sculk Catalyst
